## Designing Neural Network for Bike Sharing Project
In this repository, you can have a notebook that provides design flow on how to build your Multilayer Neural Network (MLP) from scratch. This is a good starting point if you want to learn into details about what happen inside MLP. You are encouraged to learn neural network in theory and mathematics to have good command in this notebook.


## Make Use of This Repo
This repo is originally from [udacity_pytorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). You are encouraged to exercise to build your own Multilayer Neural Network(MLP) in `your_answer.py`. I have included the solution as well in `my_solution.py`. You can use this solution if you are stuck along the way. However, you encouraged to use your own thinking and understanding first.

Once you have completed all TODOs in `your_answer.py`, you can head to your `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb` to run and debug your code.

Enjoy your time! Happy learning!
