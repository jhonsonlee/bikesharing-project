## Designing Neural Network for Bike Sharing Project
In this repository, you can have a notebook that provides design flow on how to build your Multilayer Neural Network (MLP) from scratch. This is a good starting point if you want to learn into detail about what happen inside MLP. You are encouraged to learn neural network in theory and mathematics to have good command in this notebook.
