# Designing Neural Network for Bike Sharing Project

## Overview
In bike-sharing company, allocating bikes based on the time when many people need them is a challenging task. This project address this issue by leveraging Neural Network to predict the potential number of people who will use the bikes with respect to time. In this project, I have designed and implemented Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP) from scratch in Python and Numpy. This sample project offers good learning resources for whom are beginners in deep neural networks.


## Make Use of This Repo
This repo is originally from [udacity_pytorch](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). You are encouraged to exercise to build your own Multilayer Neural Network(MLP) in `your_answer.py`. I have included the solution as well in `my_solution.py`. You can use this solution if you are stuck along the way. However, you encouraged to use your own thinking and understanding first.

Once you have completed all TODOs in `your_answer.py`, you can head to your `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb` to run and debug your code.

Enjoy your time! Happy learning!


## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository into your machine by typing the following command on your Linux terminal or Windows command prompt.
`> git clone https://github.com/jhonsonlee/bikesharing-project.git`
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook in your machine by typing the following command.
`> jupyter notebook`
3. On your Jupyter Notebook console head to the directory where your clone the repository and then open `your_answer.py`.
4. Complete all the exercise and if you are stuck please head to `my_solution.py`.
